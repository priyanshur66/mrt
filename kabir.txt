Soil, tell the pot maker, you think you are kicking me and kneading me with your feet. There will be a day when you will be below me (after death), I will knead you

Sant Kabir das says in this couplet that too much of anything is bad, so one must exercise control and be moderate in everything. Too much talking is not good; neither is too much quietness. Just like how too much rain is not good, and neither is too much sunshine.
